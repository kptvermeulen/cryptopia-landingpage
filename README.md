# Cryptopia NFT

Cryptopia is an independent city-state society based on the blockchain, where citizens can buy, sell, vote, and perform other essential activities using a safe, secure, and transparent system.

Additionally, as a seasteading city-state, Cryptopia lies outside of any existing nation’s borders, allowing its citizens free reign to experiment and create the community they want for themselves. Cryptopia has become humanity’s haven, the reboot of society the world needs to survive.
